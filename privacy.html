<p>Synopsys, Inc. (&ldquo;<strong>Synopsys</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>we</strong>&rdquo;) is committed to protecting your privacy when you use the embARC  service (the &ldquo;<strong>Site</strong>&rdquo;). Accordingly, we  are providing this privacy policy (&ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;) to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure  of information that we receive when you use the Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are  accessible through the Site. Also,  please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all  capitalized words used in this Privacy  Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions for Use of <a href="http://www.embarc.org/terms.html">http://www.embarc.org/terms.html</a>. </p>
                    <p><strong>How do we collect and use information?</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve  the Site, to administer your use of the Site (including your Account, if you  are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. <br>
  <u>Registration</u>.  In order to use certain features or areas of  this Site, you first must complete a registration form and create an Account.  If you create an Account, we&rsquo;ll collect certain information that can be used to  identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address and phone number  (&ldquo;PII&rdquo;). We may use PII to contact you about the services on our Site in which  you have expressed interest. PII may also be shared with other users and data  providers on the Site for their products, services and information in which you  have expressed an interest and from whom you have requested to receive more  information or if you downloaded binary or source code information they made  available on the Site. This information may also be shared with Synopsys&rsquo;  subsidiaries and business partners. <br>
  <u>Information Collected Using Cookies</u>. Some pages of the  Site use &ldquo;cookies,&rdquo; which are small text files that are saved on your computer by  your browser when you access the Site. We may use  both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you&rsquo;ve logged in  to the Site and to tell us how and when you interact with the Site. Cookies help us  recognize your user preferences and can improve your future web visits. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic  routing on the Site and to customize and improve the Site. Unlike persistent  cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Site and close  your browser.  Although most browsers automatically accept  cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting  cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that  if you don&rsquo;t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or  features of the Site. Additionally,  some third-party services providers that we engage  (including third-party advertisers) may place their own cookies on your computer.  Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not  include use of cookies by such third parties.</p>
                    <p><u>Information  Related to Use of the Site</u>. As is true of most  websites, our servers  automatically record and store certain information about how a person uses the Site  (we refer to this information as &ldquo;<strong>Log Data</strong>&rdquo;). Log Data may include  information such as a user&rsquo;s internet protocol (IP) address, browser type,  internet services provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system,  date/time stamp and other statistics. We use this information to analyze  trends, to administer the Site, to track a user&rsquo;s movements around the Site, to  enhance a user&rsquo;s experience in using the Site and to gather demographic  information about our user base as a whole. We may use a  person&rsquo;s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the  IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Site  is used.</p>
                    <p><u>Surveys or Contests</u>. From time to time  we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our  Site. If you participate, we may request certain PII from you. Participation in  these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a  choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information  typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and  demographic information (such as zip code). We use this information to notify  contest winners and award prizes, and sometimes to send participants an email  newsletter, if requested. In some cases, we may use a third-party services  provider to conduct these surveys or contests; any such provider is prohibited  from using our users&rsquo; PII for any other purpose.</p>
                    <p><u>&ldquo;EMAIL THIS ARTICLE&rdquo; Referrals</u>. If you choose to  use the &ldquo;Email this article&rdquo; function (on web pages where it is available) in  order to send another person the article, we will ask you for the recipient&rsquo;s  email address and your email address. We will automatically send the recipient  a one-time email that includes a text-only version of the article.</p>
                    <p><strong>Communications</strong><br>
                      <br>
                  <u>Special Offers</u>. We may occasionally  send you information on products and services that might be of interest to you.  You have the option not to receive these types of communications and may  unsubscribe to these messages at any time. Please refer to the &ldquo;Choice and  Opt-out&rdquo; section below for more details.</p>
                    <p><u>Newsletters And Updates</u>. If you wish to  subscribe to any newsletter(s) and updates provided through the Site, we will  use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. You have to  option not to receive these types of communications and may unsubscribe to  these messages at any time. Please refer to the &ldquo;Choice and Opt-out&rdquo; section  below for more details.</p>
                    <p><u>Additional Information Requests</u>. If you request to  receive additional information from or if you download binary or source code  information of other users and data providers about the products and services  they have provided on the Site, they may contact you directly about their  products and services. We do not send you such information on their behalf and  are not responsible for such communications (or any subsequent communications).  If you do not wish to receive further communications from them, you must  contact them in accordance with their privacy statements.</p>
                    <p><u>Service-Related Announcements</u>. We may send you service-related  announcements regarding the Site when it is necessary to do so. Because these  communications are not promotional, you do not have the ability to unsubscribe  to these messages.</p>
                    <p><u>Choice And Opt-Out</u>. If you no longer  wish to receive a particular newsletter or update and/or other promotional  communications from us, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the  instructions included in each respective communication. Please note that other  users and data providers that are available on the Site have their own data  privacy policies, which may differ from ours, and you would have to contact  them separately with respect to any opt-out requests of their communications.</p>
                    <p><strong>What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?</strong><strong> </strong><br>
                      <br>
                  We  will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as  described below:</p>
                    <p><u>Information  Accessible in Public Areas of the Site</u>. Please be  aware that any  PII you post in a publicly viewable area of the Site can be read, collected or  used by other users of the Site, and could be used to send you unsolicited  messages. We are not responsible for any PII that you choose to post in a  publicly viewable area of the Site. </p>
                    <p><u>Information  Shared with Agents and Services Providers</u>. We occasionally engage  other companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf, including  engaging companies and individuals as either agents or services providers to  work with us to administer the Site. We only  provide third-party agents and services providers with the minimum amount of  PII necessary to complete the requested services. These third-party agents and services providers have access to your  PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly  obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose. We do not sell,  rent, share, or otherwise disclose PII from our users for commercial purposes. </p>
                  <p><u>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</u>. We cooperate with government and law enforcement  officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We reserve the  right to disclose any information about you (including your PII) to government  or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion,  believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process  (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the  property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and  (iii)&nbsp;to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally  actionable activity. </p>
                    <p><u>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions</u>. Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is  considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we  go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a  transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be  disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the  transaction. <br>
                      <u>Information Shared with Third Parties</u>. We  reserve the right to fully use and disclose any information collected via the  Site that is not in a personally identifiable form. Additionally, we may share  aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for  industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar  purposes. </p>
                    <p><strong>Links to other sites</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      The Site may contain  links to other websites and services that are not owned or controlled by us. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party  website or service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the website  or service and is subject to that party's privacy policy. This Privacy Policy  does not apply to any third-party&rsquo;s websites or services and we&rsquo;re not  responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of  those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you  carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you  access. </p>
                    <p><strong>Security</strong><br>
                      <br>
                  Transmissions over  the Internet are never 100% secure or error-free. However, the security of your  PII is important to us. We take reasonable administrative,  physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII)  from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information  on our registration forms we encrypt that information using secure socket layer  technology (SSL). </p>
                  <p><strong>International Transfers</strong><br>
                    <br>
                      Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers  located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental  jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your  jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to  provide information to us, your information is transferred to the United States  and processed there. By your submission of such information you are agreeing  and consenting to such a transfer.</p>
                    <p><strong>Modifying Your Information </strong><br>
                      <br>
                      You can access and modify the PII you provide to us via the Site. If  you want us to delete your PII, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@synopsys.com">privacy@synopsys.com</a> with your request. We&rsquo;ll  take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some  information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as  otherwise required by law.</p>
                    <p><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in  effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, modify and  revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes  to this Privacy Policy, we&rsquo;ll notify you of such changes by posting them on the  Site or by sending you an email or other notification, and we&rsquo;ll indicate when  such changes will become effective.</p>
